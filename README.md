## Keras - TensorFlow API Project Exercise - Pierian Data Inc.

Project made during the course TensorFlow 2 and Keras - Created by Jose Portilla

## The Data
We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

## Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model!

## Requirements:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- lxml
- matplotlib
- pandas
- Pillow
- scikit-learn
- numpy
